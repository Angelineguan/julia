<p><em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/julia">Julia</a></em> is a lightweight high performance http server(imaging that it is tiny nginx).</p>
<p>The repo is under developing yet. Full Supporting for <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a> is only in completed now. At least, it works and can serve static resources and pass request for dynamic resource to backend(this site is powered by <em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/julia">julia</a></em>).</p>
<p>I have suspended this project for a few months after it has worked.</p>
<p>Now i restart it, planning to complete the supporting for RFC 2616, and then build a simple script language to serve dynamic resources(imbedded in the server directly).</p>
<h2 id="try-it">TRY IT</h2>
<p>Fork the repo, install it following the instruction. Modify the config file to your port and document root.</p>

<p>Development of <em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/julia">julia</a></em> is interrupted by another project:<em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/wgtcc">wgtcc</a></em>. <em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/wgtcc">Wgtcc</a></em> is a simple yet powerful C11 compiler. As you may guessed, <strong>server of this site is compiled by <em><a href="https://github.com/wgtdkp/wgtcc">wgtcc</a></em>!</strong></p>
<p>So, to make things cooler, i may continue making my script language:)</p>
