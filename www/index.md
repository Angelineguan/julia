# _[julia]_
_[Julia]_ is a lightweight high performance http server.

The repo is under developing yet. Full Supporting for [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) is only in grammar now. At least, it works and can serve static resources(this site is powered by _[julia]_).

I have suspended this project for a few months after it has worked.

Now i restart it, planning to complete the supporting for RFC 2616, and then build a simple script language to serve dynamic resources(or use php directly).

## TRY IT
Fork the repo, install it following the instruction. Modify the config file to your port and document root.

## WHAT ELSE
Development of _[julia]_ is interrupted by another project:_[wgtcc]_. _[Wgtcc]_ is a simple yet powerful C11 compiler. As you may guessed, **server of this site is compiled by _[wgtcc]_!**

So, to make things cooler, i may continue making my script language:)
